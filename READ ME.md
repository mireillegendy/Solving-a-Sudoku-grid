The purpose of this project is to process a live image, of a sudoku grid, displayed as an input, and have an algorithm
solve the puzzle and display the solution to the grid.
The project is divided in three main parts:
1) The algorithm to solve the grid:
This portion comprises of the core algorithm the solves the sudoku puzzle. The algorithm accepts any unsolved grid, and
displays the answer the answer. The code to this part of the project is in script1.py file.
2) The image processing component of the algorithm
The second portion of the project analyzes the input image of the sudoku grid to extract the unsolved grid.
3) The neural network to understand the hand written digits
The last component of the algorithm is a neural network that recognizes the hand written digits and converts them to
the computer can comprehend.
